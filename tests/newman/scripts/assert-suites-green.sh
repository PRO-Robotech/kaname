# assert-suites-green.sh — shared newman suite-green gate for EVERY kacho repo's
# .github/workflows/newman-e2e.yml. Run with cwd = kacho-iam/tests/newman
# (collections/ + out/ live there; all repos checkout kacho-iam@main and run the
# shared gen.py + run.sh, so the per-suite reports are identical).
#
# WHY this is shared (KAC — newman gate consolidation): each repo's
# newman-e2e.yml used to carry its own inline copy of the verdict logic, and the
# copies drifted — fixes for get-malformed (api-gateway#73), delete-binding
# (iam#108) and the user-per-account invite (iam#113, migration 0011) only ever
# reached kacho-iam's copy, so vpc/compute/nlb/api-gateway/deploy stayed RED on the
# very same shared suites that kacho-iam reported GREEN. One script = one source of
# truth; a change to the verdict lands everywhere at once.
#
# NOTHING IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE VERDICT. This gate reports the counts newman
# reported. The "known-RED" whitelist that used to sit in the loop below was
# removed 2026-07-30 after its third narrowing — see the note at the subtraction
# site for why narrowing could never fix it. Outstanding red is carried as a
# counted, named debt in docs/RESULTS.md, not as a silent deduction here.
#
# FOUR OUTCOMES, FOUR NAMES. A request ends one of four ways, and this gate
# reports each separately because folding any of them into another is how a suite
# goes quiet:
#   answered + assertion passed  — the check ran and said yes;
#   answered + assertion failed  — the check ran and said no      (`failed`);
#   answered + SCRIPT CRASHED    — the check never got to run     (`SCRIPT FAILED`);
#   NOT ANSWERED                 — nothing came back              (`UNANSWERED`).
# Plus the degenerate case of a report containing no assertions at all, which is
# printed as NOTHING RAN rather than being allowed to read as "nothing failed".
# None of the three non-passing outcomes is ever subtracted, whitelisted or
# explained away.
#
# The third one was missing until 2026-07-29, and it was invisible by construction:
# newman books a test-script exception under `scripts`/`testScripts`, NOT under
# `assertions.failed` (an assertion that never ran cannot fail) and NOT under
# `requests.failed` (a response did arrive). A case whose script threw on its first
# line therefore reached this gate reading exactly like a clean one — `0 failed,
# 0 UNANSWERED` — with none of its checks performed. Measured on newman 6.2.2: a body
# the script cannot parse yields `assertions.failed=0, requests.failed=0,
# testScripts.failed=1`.

# ─── Execution-coverage gate ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The assertion-based verdict below can only see requests that RAN. A request
# that never executed produces no assertions and therefore no failures — so a
# collection that stopped after 6 of its 46 requests reads exactly like one that
# ran all 46 cleanly, and this gate called both GREEN.
#
# That was not hypothetical: a poll pre-request guard used
# `setNextRequest(null)` meaning "skip this poll when the create was rejected and
# no operation id exists". `setNextRequest(null)` does not skip a request, it ENDS
# THE RUN — and the guard fires deterministically on negative cases. The iam suite
# executed 1177 of 1502 requests (78.4%) while every collection was gated GREEN;
# what went unexecuted was the authz-deny data-leak matrix, the ROLE/INV/USR/ESC
# deny matrices and the fail-closed OpenFGA-outage case.
#
# exec-coverage.py closes that: per collection it requires every leaf request to
# have executed or to be STATICALLY EXPLAINED (an explicit `skipRequest()` guard,
# or a literal forward `setNextRequest('<name>')` that jumps over it), and it bans
# `setNextRequest(null)` outright. It runs BEFORE the assertion loop because a
# truncated run makes the assertion counts meaningless.
#
# Its exit code carries THREE answers, not two, and they are kept apart here:
# 1 = coverage gaps found in this tree's run; 3 = there was no usable run to draw
# a coverage verdict from (out/ empty, or holding another tree's reports). Both
# stop the pipeline, but they send a reader to different places — one to a suite
# that lost requests, the other to a runner that did not produce evidence. Folding
# 3 into the same label would reintroduce, one level up, exactly the confusion the
# gate now refuses to commit: an unasked question wearing an answer's name.

  # A request has three possible ends, and this gate used to have names for only
  # two: a response arrived (whatever its status), an assertion said no, or
  # NOTHING CAME BACK. The third had no home, so it was filed under the first.
  #
  # What stood here was a filter that removed EAI_AGAIN/ENOTFOUND/getaddrinfo
  # from this count, on the stated grounds that an unreachable endpoint IS the
  # internal-only invariant being asserted. It is not. "I could not reach it"
  # and "it refused me" are different findings, and only one of them is evidence.
  # The filter, together with a case assertion phrased "if the status code is
  # undefined, return" (a pass) and an execution-coverage check that read a
  # cursor position as proof of execution, meant all three layers reported
  # success for eight ban-#6 negatives — the checks that Internal* RPCs are not
  # reachable on the advertised external endpoint — while none of them ran. The
  # verdict printed "0 failed requests".
  #
  # The harness now reaches the external listener (deploy/scripts/newman-*.sh
  # forward the api-gateway TLS port and inject externalBaseUrl), so an
  # unanswered request here means the harness is broken or the endpoint is down.
  # Either is worth stopping for; neither is a green check.

  # (something was answered), so a case that checked NOTHING was indistinguishable
  # from a case that checked everything and agreed.
  #
  # Pre-request scripts count too, for a sharper reason than symmetry: in these suites
  # the pre-request script is what upserts the Authorization header naming the SUBJECT
  # the case is about (gen.py::_auth_pre_script). A crash there does not skip the
  # request — it sends it with whatever header was already on it, i.e. as a DIFFERENT
  # principal, and the expected 401/403 then still holds for the wrong reason.
  #
  # NEVER subtracted and never whitelisted: an exception is not a known-RED product
  # gap, it is a case that did not run.

  # NO SUBTRACTION. The failure count printed and gated below is the one newman

  #
  # What stood here was a "known-RED" whitelist: a jq alternation over case names
  # whose matches were subtracted from `fails` before the verdict. It was narrowed
  # twice and removed on the third audit, and the reason it had to go is the shape
  # of those three revisions rather than the size of any one of them.
  #
  #   v1 subtracted BY FOLDER — 259 assertions across 17 folders, and a folder is
  #      not a finding. It swallowed a P1 leak canary that happened to sit in a
  #      matched folder.
  #   v2 subtracted BY STEP inside those folders — smaller, same kind.
  #   v3 subtracted by STEP-NAME SUFFIX (`-rya<N>`, `get-abs<N>`) — 27 assertions,
  #      including a placement-coherence NEGATIVE
  #      (LST-UPD-STATE-DEFAULT-TG-REGION-MISMATCH).
  #
  # Each narrowing was a correct local fix and none of them touched the defect. The
  # predicate keys on a NAME, and the thing it claims to select — "this failure is
  # the known materialization lag, not a real refusal" — is a statement about the
  # REASON a step failed. The reason is not in the name. So the predicate cannot
  # distinguish its subject from a stranger in principle, at any width, and every
  # narrowing just reduced how many strangers it caught per run without changing
  # that it catches them. A fourth narrowing would have been the same move again.
  #
  # A mechanism that DOES key on the reason already exists and stays: the bounded
  # per-step retry (`retry_until_authorized` / `retry_until_absent` / the poll
  # loops) — it retries while the response says the specific transient thing, and
  # when the budget is spent the real assertion runs on the terminal response, so a
  # genuine deny still fails. That is a check about behaviour; a name-match is not.
  #
  # The debt this uncovers is not hidden, it is COUNTED: docs/RESULTS.md carries the
  # case list and the number. A red on a real disagreement is worth more than a
  # green obtained by not asking (testing.md — "E2E НИКОГДА не пропускаются").
  #
  # HARNESS-CONFIG failures were the one class this whitelist had to explicitly
  # exclude from itself, because 15 guarded requests sat under names it matched.
  # With no subtraction there is nothing to exclude from: they simply count.
