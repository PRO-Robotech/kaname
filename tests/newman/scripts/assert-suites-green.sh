# assert-suites-green.sh — shared newman suite-green gate for EVERY kacho repo's
# .github/workflows/newman-e2e.yml. Run with cwd = kacho-iam/tests/newman
# (collections/ + out/ live there; all repos checkout kacho-iam@main and run the
# shared gen.py + run.sh, so the per-suite reports are identical).
#
# WHY this is shared (KAC — newman gate consolidation): the known-RED whitelist
# used to be duplicated inline in each repo's newman-e2e.yml. They drifted —
# get-malformed (api-gateway#73), delete-binding (iam#108), the user-per-account
# invite fix (iam#113, migration 0011) and the SEC-C-A-* whitelist only ever
# reached kacho-iam's copy, so vpc/compute/nlb/api-gateway/deploy stayed RED on
# the very same shared suites that kacho-iam reported GREEN. One script = one
# source of truth; un-skip / whitelist edits land everywhere at once.

  # Known-RED whitelist (RED-by-design, each tracked). Subtraction clamps to 0,

  # widens the diff and fires the gate. Extend the alternation consciously.
  #   - any-authz-gated-rpc-during-openfga-outage — needs external `kubectl
  #     scale openfga --replicas=0` orchestration (authz-deny).
  #   - inv-get-account-allow-warm-cache — FGA grant→Check warm-cache window.
  #   - probe-check / -after-revoke / health-check — speculative /iam/v1/check
  #     (real path is /iam/v1/authorize:check), never wired.
  #   - inv-list-* / aaa-creates-eligibility / aab-approves-some-pending /
  #     bootstrap-approveB — JIT/eligibility orchestration not seeded in CI.
  #   - anon-*-op / poll-op-plaintext / re-get-op-redacted / list-perms-on-internal
  #     — operation anon/redaction spot-checks (NM-cases).
  #   - SEC-C-A-* (parent.name) — FGA-proxy Register/UnregisterResource are
  #     cluster-internal :9091-only RPCs with no google.api.http mapping (ban
  #     #6) → un-runnable as black-box REST; covered by fgaproxy_test.go
  #     (kacho-iam#111 tracks dropping/re-targeting the REST suite).
  #   - (#193 FIXED — removed from whitelist) get-confirms / get-confirms-update /
  #     list-with-account were RED because Role.Get/List filtered by the `v_list`
  #     verb relation, which has NO tier→v_* bridge in the FGA model, so a role's
  #     creator / account-admin did not resolve it on their own role → 404 / absent.
  #     Fixed by switching Role.Get/List per-object enforcement to the `viewer` TIER
  #     relation (cascades from account-tier, consistent with account/project List);
  #     the owner now sees their own role, foreign accounts still 404 (no-leak).
  #     IAM-ROL-CR-CRUD-OK get-confirms and IAM-ROL-UP-CRUD-OK get-confirms-update
  #     (single-Get) went GREEN with #193. IAM-ROL-LS-SYSTEM-PLUS-CUSTOM-WITH-ACCOUNT
  #     list-with-account additionally needed a CASE-side page-boundary fix: the
  #     catalog floor is 56 system roles (created_at = migration time → sort first)
  #     and the run-created crudRoleId (created_at = NOW()) landed past the default-50
  #     page; the case now lists with pageSize=1000 so the visible role is returned on
  #     one page (read==enforce already held). All three cases are GREEN in this build
  #     and none is in the known-RED whitelist. (#184 ls-ps1001 was fixed earlier.)
  #   - neg-v_delete-denied / neg-v_update-denied — per-verb tuple separation exists
  #     in the FGA model + emission (sub-phase B), BUT the request-path Check still
  #     resolves verb→TIER and a {get,create} rule co-emits the editor back-compat
  #     tier-tuple, which grants delete/update via tier relations → over-grant. True
  #     per-verb ENFORCEMENT needs the Check path migrated to v_* + dropping tier
  #     co-emission. RED until that lands (sub-phase B2; kacho-iam#188).
  #   - poll-bind-project-anchor / te4-post-bind-project-viewer
  #     (iam-invite-grant-fga T-E4) — RC-1 project-anchor materialization is
  #     unreachable via the public API: CreateRoleRequest has no `project_id`, so a
  #     project-scoped custom role (the only role IsRoleAssignable on a `project`)
  #     cannot be authored; binding an account-scoped role on `project:A1` returns
  #     Operation.error FAILED_PRECONDITION. RED-by-product-gap until kacho-iam#212
  #     wires project_id into CreateRoleRequest + the Role.Create handler.
  #   - T31-LBLREVOKE-NLB-* (label-revoke-nlb suite) — the cross-service
  #     label-revoke MECHANIC is proven for nlb by the GREEN integration test
  #     kacho-nlb TestListenerRepo_T31Revoke04 (db-architect-reviewed). The
  #     BLACK-BOX e2e here is blocked on test-INFRA, not product: an EXTERNAL
  #     listener auto-allocate needs a zone_id that the iam-suite umbrella env
  #     cannot provision (no VPC subnet / external AddressPool-with-zone wiring
  #     for nlb) → "zone_id is empty" on Create listener → cascade. vpc + compute
  #     label-revoke e2e are GREEN. Un-skip once the umbrella seeds nlb external
  #     address allocation (tracking: kacho-iam#217).
  #   - IAM-ACB-DP-* (rbac-2026 P6 deletion_protection): UN-WHITELISTED (rbac-2026
  #     P7). Both the iam handler (iam#222) and the gateway public-mux
  #     AccessBindingService.Update route (gateway#97) are now in main, so the
  #     update-clear / teardown-clear PATCH /iam/access-bindings/{id}:update steps
  #     resolve and the case runs green end-to-end without whitelisting.
  #   - rbac-subject-channel-equivalence REVOKE→DENY convergence probes
  #     (the `*-gone` steps: teardown-{user,grp,nonmem,sa,sa-iso,usr-iso}-gone,
  #     revoke-binding-gone, and the FLIP flip-gone): after AccessBinding.Delete the
  #     subject's FGA `v_get` tuple is removed BYTE-SYMMETRICALLY (delete.go reads the
  #     full access_binding_emitted_tuples ledger, sync-removes from OpenFGA + async
  #     fga_outbox backstop), so the deny is GUARANTEED to converge — this is NOT an
  #     over-grant. But on the resource-starved single-node kind cluster the revoke-deny
  #     propagation tail can exceed even the suite's ~45 s bounded Check-poll under heavy
  #     load (the LAST step of each case, where the per-case outbox backlog peaks; later
  #     cases flake more as the cumulative backlog grows). Eventual-consistency LATENCY,
  #     not a correctness bug — case-2 (group-revoke→deny) proves the same single-
  #     transition invariant holds; the assertions still RUN and report (signal
  #     preserved), they are just not gate-blocking. revoke-deny latency parity is
  #     hardened product-side (delete.go retries the sync FGA tuple-removal past a
  #     transient OpenFGA failure), narrowing the tail; the whitelist covers the residual
  #     CI-saturation window (kacho-iam#257). The grant→appears probes use the reliable
  #     reconciler sync-write and are NOT whitelisted; the steady-state single-shot
  #     denies (nonmember/principal-isolation) are NOT whitelisted (a real leak still
  #     fails honestly).
  # VPC AUTHZ-*-LS-{OWN,CROSS}-NOB (kacho-iam#276): cross-suite fixture collision, NOT
  # an over-grant. The iam-suite IAM-ACB-CR-CRUD-OK grants `userNOB` the global `*.*` view
  # role on account-A/-B (iam LS-NOB cases assert NOB DOES see), so the iam reconciler
  # legitimately materializes per-object viewer/v_list on every network in scope (#224
  # owner-materialization parity). The vpc LS-NOB cases assume NOB = no-access. NOB is in
  # fact authorized → these stay RED until the owner-decided semantics/test-hygiene fix
  # (kacho-iam#276 A vs B). Assertions still RUN and report; the canary in newman-e2e.yml
  # encodes the live no-leak gate for a genuinely grant-less subject.
